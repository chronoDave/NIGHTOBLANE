# NIGHTOBLANE

*Freshly minted pixels just for you*

## What's this about?

This repo is the source code behind [NIGHTOBLANE](https://nightoblane.neocities.org/), my personal website.

## Just HTML and CSS, that's it?

Yep, that's right, just as Tim Berners-Lee had envisioned all those years ago. Sometimes all you need is just some simple CSS and HTML. Well, that, and some nice pixel art, of course.

## But why?

Because [it's still a motherfucking website](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/). Sometimes less is more, y'know?
